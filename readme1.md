This is a set up for my very first repository on GitHub.  
Life is not so much about what you know as how much effort you put in. <br />
Line breaks by adding this tag <br_/> (where _ is a blank space) at the end each
line. <br />

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate replay text.
> This is a very long line that will be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boys
> let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for
> everyone . Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

| Tables              | Are                | Cool            |
| ------------------- | :----------------: | ---------------:|
| col 3 is            | right-aligned      |    $1600        |
| col 2 is            | centered           |             $12 |
| zebra stripes       | are neat           | $1              |

## Feature
* Build useful web application with only a few lines of code&mdash;no JavaScript
  required.
* Attractive default UI theme based on [Bootstrap] (http://getbootstrap.com/).

To install the lastest development builds directly from GitHub, run this
instead:

'''r
if (!required("devtools"))
    install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/shiny")
'''
